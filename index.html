    <h1>Nerve Regeneration: Neuroma Reduction</h1>
    <h2>Allison MacMartin, Tyler Naus, & Yousra Zouani

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class = "b">
    <p>Symptomatic neuroma is a painful sequela of traumatic or oncologic nerve amputations. Our goal is to reduce/prevent neuroma by isolating transected nerve stumps within protective "caps" during surgery.</p>
    <p>Neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system and can manifest following nerve injury—especially amputation. A neuroma forms as an injured nerve end starts to regenerate in a disorganized way, resulting in a lump of entangled axon fibers and non-neural tissue growth. Neuroma is understood to occur from misdirected Schwann cell processes in the absence of a distal target—causing pathophysiologic axon outgrowth as the nerve cells try to reinstate continuity.</p>
    <p>Aside from affecting quality of life, symptomatic neuroma can make molding a well-fitting prosthesis socket difficult, and/or prevent its successful use.</p>
    <p>Neuroma formation phases:<br>
      <br>1. Injured nerve end/degenerating axons
      <br>2. Axonal sprouts
      <br>3. Unorganized bundles of axons
      <br>4. Growth into muscle tissue
      <br>5. Growth into fibrous tissue (neuroma)</p>
    <p>Current treatment for painful neuroma includes prescription drugs, and more commonly surgical removal. The standard or care for surgical management of stump neuroma is traction neurectomy. During this technique, a neurolysis is performed and the nerve is exposed. Then the nerve is put under traction and transected to healthy nerve. Yet, traction neurectomy alone cannot prevent neuroma from re-forming as the nerve end regenerates.</p>

    <p><b>Biocompatabilty:</b> Device needs to produce the appropriate host response for the given body contact and duration conditions: permanent contact: implant device.</p>
    <p><b>Cytotoxicity:</b> Device material(s) cannot cause significant cell damage or death as measured by a cytotoxicity assay (the FDA requires implant devices to undergo cytotoxicity testing at 37&#8451 for 72 hr.).</p>
    <p><b>Different sizes:</b> Device sizes of 3 mm and 5 mm diameter to fit the range of nerve diameters for the wrist/dorsum base of the hand.</p>
    <p><b>Durable:</b> Cannot mechanically fail (e.g., tear) during and after implantation.</p>
    <p><b>Ease of implementation in the clinic:</b> Storage life of at least 32 months. Does not require custom or specific surgical instruments for implantation.</p>
    <p><b>Low-cost:</b> Cost per unit less than 20,000 USD.</p>
    <p><b>Reduce pain/neuroma:</b> Eliminate axonal outgrowth into muscle or fibrous tissue. Reduce pain (100 mm visual analog scale reading of 0 to 4 mm [no pain] or 5 to 44 mm [mild pain]).</p>
    <p><b>Sterilization:</b> Device must meet the appropriate Sterility Assurance Level.</p>
    --
    <p>Immediately after traction neurectomy, our device is implanted to cap the nerve end to isolate subsequent regeneration from surrounding tissue to reduce/prevent neuroma. We are focusing on neuroma of the wrist and dorsum base of the hand, as this region is where neuroma is most often observed in the upper limb.</p>

    <p>The nerve cap is one part and is comprised of the material collagen. The nerve stump diameter is measured to determine the appropriate cap size. The cap fits (with clearance) over the nerve with an overlap up to 5 mm as indicated by the gray area in Fig. 3. The luminal collagen surface will bond to the nerve via PTB technique. In this respect, the cap is fully constrained to the nerve stump. The regenerating nerve cells are limited to the space within the cap. This “runway” space is 5 mm in length (so that the total cap length is 10 mm). As the cross-sectional area of the cap decreases along the runway, a 4 mm partition divides the inner volume of the cap into two parts. The partition serves two purposes; it helps guide axons to reduce entanglement, and it provides an internal architecture to support the distal end of the cap.</p>
    <p>The cap provides a protective layer from surrounding tissue and prevents the regenerating nerve end from growing into muscle or fibrous tissue. It also prevents adhesions to the surrounding soft tissue bed. Overtime, the collagen will integrate with the immediate tissue. In this aspect it is a permanent implant.</p>
    <p>The 5 mm length constituting the PTB surface area was determined from the overlapping length of nerve guide conduits which were sutured to the nerve. PTB has been used effectively in other nerve repair models, and is advantageous when compared to medical suture in that PTB is atraumatic. The 5 mm “runway” is based on several studies which showed minimal axon infiltration past 5 mm in hollow tubes. The cap thickness is at minimum 0.25 mm—based on nerve guide conduit thicknesses.</p>
