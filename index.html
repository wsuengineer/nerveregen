    <h1>Nerve Regeneration: Neuroma Reduction</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class = "b">
    <p>Symptomatic neuroma is a painful sequela of traumatic or oncologic nerve amputations. Our goal is to reduce/prevent neuroma by isolating transected nerve stumps within protective "caps" during surgery.</p>
    <p>Neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system and can manifest following nerve injury—especially amputation. A neuroma forms as an injured nerve end starts to regenerate in a disorganized way, resulting in a bulbous mass of entangled axon fibers and non-neural tissue growth. Neuroma is understood to occur from misdirected Schwann cell processes in the absence of a distal target—causing pathophysiologic axon outgrowth as the nerve cells try to reinstate continuity.<br><br>Source: <a href="https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(09)01121-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuromas of the Hand and Upper Extremity</a></p>
    <p>Aside from affecting quality of life, symptomatic neuroma can make molding a well-fitting prosthesis socket difficult, and/or prevent its successful use.</p>
    <p>Neuroma formation phases:<br>
      <br>1. Injured nerve end/degenerating axons
      <br>2. Axonal sprouts
      <br>3. Unorganized bundles of axons
      <br>4. Growth into muscle tissue
      <br>5. Growth into fibrous tissue (neuroma)</p>
    <p>Current treatment for painful neuroma includes pharmacological therapy, and more commonly; surgical removal. The standard or care for surgical management of stump neuroma is traction neurectomy. During this technique, a neurolysis is performed and the nerve is exposed. Then the nerve is put under traction and transected to healthy nerve. Yet, traction neurectomy alone cannot prevent neuroma from re-forming as the nerve end regenerates. Alternatively, the nerve stump may be buried into adjacent muscle tissue or bone. While this procedure mitigates external stimulation that causes the painful sensation, it requires an additional disection into otherwise healthy tissue, may not always be anatomically possible, and exposes the patient to further risks.<br><br>Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7249462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application of a Porcine Small Intestine Submucosa Nerve Cap for Prevention of Neuromas and Associated Pain</a></p>

    <p><b>Design overview</b>:
    <br>
    <br>-	Material is decellularized, GLU-treated bovine/porcine pericardium. Will vascularize and integrate with surrounding tissue to form a protective layer—as opposed to degrading.
<br>-	Relatively easy fabrication process. Tube (Fig. 1) is molded into form given in Fig. 2 using PTB technique.
<br>-	Distal end is flattened to permit suture to anchor device in tissue.
<br>-	Nerve cap bonds to proximal nerve end via PTB. Cap clearance fits over the nerve, luminal surface is cross-linked with the collagenous epineurial surface.
<br>-	PTB gives a strong seal, cap provides internal environment for regenerating nerve end isolated from external mechanical stimuli and neurotrophic signaling, prevent nerve end neuroma.
<br>-	Aligned nanofibers at the start of the gap ensure axons grow outward. 
<br>-	Cap provides for 5-6 mm of “runway” to exhaust nerve regeneration.
<br>-	Cap sizes of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm.</p>
    <p>Once the nerve is surgically transected, the nerve cap is implanted to cap the nerve end in order to isolate subsequent regeneration from surrounding tissue to reduce/prevent neuroma. The device is designed for nerves of the wrist and dorsum base of the hand, as this region is <a href="https://meeting.handsurgery.org/abstracts/2020/HSEP140.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">where neuroma is most often observed in the upper limb.</a></p>
    <p>The nerve cap is one part and is comprised of decellularize GLU-treated bovine/porcine pericardium (same as used in bioprosthetic heart valves). The nerve stump diameter is measured to determine the appropriate cap size. The cap fits (with clearance) over the nerve with an overlap up to 5 mm as indicated by the gray area in Fig. 3. The luminal surface will bind to the collagenous epineurium via PTB technique. In this respect, the cap is fully constrained to the nerve stump. The regenerating nerve cells are limited to the space within the cap. This “runway” space is 5-6 mm in length (so that the total cap length is 12 mm). Aligned nanofibers at the beginning of the gap direct axon outgrowth along the length of the cap.</p>
    <p>In theory, the cap provides a protective layer from mechanical stimuli and neurotrophic signaling, and prevents the regenerating nerve end from growing into muscle or fibrous tissue. It also prevents adhesions to the surrounding soft tissue bed. Over time, pericardium will integrate with surrounding tissue.</p>
    <p>The 5-6 mm length constituting the PTB surface area was determined from the overlapping length of nerve guide conduits which were sutured to the nerve. PTB has been <a href="https://www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com/article/S0022-4804(07)00037-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">successfully demonstrated in numerous tissue repair models</a> and is advantageous when compared to medical suture in that PTB is atraumatic. The 5 mm “runway” is based on <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(06)00519-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a study</a> which found minimal axon infiltration past 5 mm in hollow tubes. The cap thickness is about 0.375 mm—<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961215000721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a nerve guide conduit</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Photochemical Tissue Bonding Technique</b>:</p>
    <p>In designing our nerve cap, our goal was to permit for a sutureless procedure in the cap’s proximal attachment to the nerve stump. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a tissue repair technique that uses light and a photosensitizing dye to crosslink proteins on tissue surfaces. In PTB, a photoactive dye is applied to the tissue surfaces, followed by illumination of the surfaces with visible light. The dye absorbs strongly at the wavelength of the illumination of the tissue interfaces, and the energy of the absorbed photons is used to drive photochemical reactions. Covalent bonds are formed between protein molecules which bind the tissue surfaces together—analogous to welding. In the PTB technique, the photosensitizer used stains the tissue such that effects are limited to the surface. Overall temperature rise is negligible. This technology is generally applicable with collagenous tissues.</p>
    <p>With our nerve cap, PTB allows for the bovine/porcine pericardium cap material to crosslink with the collagenous epineurial surface of the nerve. The result is a 360&#176 seal which fully constrains the cap, and isolates the regenerating nerve end from external neurotrophic signals. The cap is sutured at the distal end in surrounding tissue.</p>
