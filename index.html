    <h1>Nerve Regeneration: Neuroma Reduction</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class = "b">
    <p>Symptomatic neuroma is a painful sequela of traumatic or oncologic nerve amputations. Our goal is to reduce/prevent neuroma by isolating transected nerve stumps within protective "caps" during surgery.</p>
    <p>Neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system and can manifest following nerve injury—especially amputation. A neuroma forms as an injured nerve end starts to regenerate in a disorganized way, resulting in a bulbous mass of entangled axon fibers and non-neural tissue growth. Neuroma is understood to occur from misdirected Schwann cell processes in the absence of a distal target—causing pathophysiologic axon outgrowth as the nerve cells try to reinstate continuity.<br><br>Source: <a href="https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(09)01121-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuromas of the Hand and Upper Extremity</a></p>
    <p>Aside from affecting quality of life, symptomatic neuroma can make molding a well-fitting prosthesis socket difficult, and/or prevent its successful use.</p>
    <p>Neuroma formation phases:<br>
      <br>1. Injured nerve end/degenerating axons
      <br>2. Axonal sprouts
      <br>3. Unorganized bundles of axons
      <br>4. Growth into muscle tissue
      <br>5. Growth into fibrous tissue (neuroma)</p>
    <p>Current treatment for painful neuroma includes pharmacological therapy, and more commonly; surgical removal. The standard or care for surgical management of stump neuroma is traction neurectomy. During this technique, a neurolysis is performed and the nerve is exposed. Then the nerve is put under traction and transected to healthy nerve. Yet, traction neurectomy alone cannot prevent neuroma from re-forming as the nerve end regenerates. Alternatively, the nerve stump may be buried into adjacent muscle tissue or bone. While this procedure mitigates external stimulation that causes the painful sensation, it requires an additional disection into otherwise healthy tissue, may not always be anatomically possible, and exposes the patient to further risks.<br><br>Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7249462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application of a Porcine Small Intestine Submucosa Nerve Cap for Prevention of Neuromas and Associated Pain</a></p>

    <p>Once the nerve is surgically transected, the nerve cap is implanted to cap the nerve end in order to isolate subsequent regeneration from surrounding tissue to reduce/prevent neuroma. The device is designed for nerves of the wrist and dorsum base of the hand, as this region is <a href="https://meeting.handsurgery.org/abstracts/2020/HSEP140.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">where neuroma is most often observed in the upper limb.</a></p>
    <p>The nerve cap is one part and is comprised of collagen/PLA composite material. The nerve stump diameter is measured to determine the appropriate cap size. The cap fits (with clearance) over the nerve with an overlap up to 5 mm as indicated by the gray area in Fig. 3. The luminal collagen surface will bind to the nerve tissue via PTB technique. In this respect, the cap is fully constrained to the nerve stump. The regenerating nerve cells are limited to the space within the cap. This “runway” space is 5 mm in length (so that the total cap length is 10 mm). As the cross-sectional area of the cap decreases along the runway, a 4 mm partition divides the inner volume of the cap into two parts. The partition serves two purposes; it helps guide axons to reduce dispersion, and it provides an internal architecture to support the distal end of the cap.</p>
    <p>In theory, the cap provides a protective layer from mechanical stimuli and neurotrophic signaling, and prevents the regenerating nerve end from growing into muscle or fibrous tissue. It also prevents adhesions to the surrounding soft tissue bed. Over time, collagen/PLA will degrade after the regenerating nerve has exhausted itself.</p>
    <p>The 5 mm length constituting the PTB surface area was determined from the overlapping length of nerve guide conduits which were sutured to the nerve. PTB has been <a href="https://www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com/article/S0022-4804(07)00037-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">successfully demonstrated in numerous tissue repair models</a> and is advantageous when compared to medical suture in that PTB is atraumatic. The 5 mm “runway” is based on <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(06)00519-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a study</a> which found minimal axon infiltration past 5 mm in hollow tubes. The cap thickness is at minimum 0.25 mm—<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961215000721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a nerve guide conduit</a> of similar material.</p>
    <p><mark>We are currently revising our cap design in favor of a multi-tubular insert to give a device that is truly unique from other nerve caps on the market. Compared to the partition, we hypothesize the tubes will provide a more robust internal architecture and more effectively increase axon alignment/reduce entanglement.</mark></p>
