<h1>Nerve Cap to Reduce Symptomatic Neuroma Following Traction Neurectomy</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Design Summary</h2>
<p> Symptomatic neuroma is a painful sequela of traumatic or oncologic nerve amputations. Our goal is to reduce peripheral nerve end neuroma by isolating transected nerve ends or stumps within protective “caps”.</p>
<p>Neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system and can manifest following traumatic nerve injury or surgery. When nerves are damaged they will naturally try to regenerate; a neuroma forms when the axons regenerate in a disorganized way, resulting in a bulbous mass of entangled axon fibers and non-neural tissue growth. Neuroma can disrupt normal nerve function and potentially cause chronic pain—in which case it is referred to as “symptomatic.” While neuromas can form in the middle of nerve (termed neuroma-in-continuity), we are specifically focusing on nerve end neuroma formation (e.g., after amputation).</p>
<p>Our solution is a device which fits over and bonds to the nerve end following transection of the current neuroma, and provides a protective environment from external mechanical stimuli and neurotrophic signaling. The cap will photo seal to the nerve in lieu of medical suture to prevent trauma to the nerve.</p>
<p>The current standard of care for symptomatic neuromas is either traction neurectomy (excision), which alone has a high rate of neuroma recurrence, or burying the nerve end into adjacent soft tissue or bone. Burying the nerve end is not always anatomically possible, and, when it is, an additional dissection of otherwise healthy tissue is required to secure the nerve end. Burial also removes the possibility of sensory recovery. Research indicates reconstructing the nerve after excising a neuroma has the highest success based on postoperative pain data. To this end, two nerve caps—from Axogen, Inc. and Polygonics, respectively—are currently being used in the clinic following stump neuroma excision.</p>
<p>The design we are proposing is critically different from currently existing caps in its use of photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) technique over medical suture. Current research has demonstrated successful use of the technique in various nerve and vascular repair models, including a study in which PTB was applied in “capping” nerve stumps. Yet, this study in particular experimented with a cap that did not permit gap space (or “runway”) within the cap for the nerve end to regenerate into.</p>
<p>We have only explored our solution theoretically. However, with a firm understanding of the problem and user needs, and consultation with experts in the field, we are confident that our design will transfer to production and implementation in the clinic. The anticipated regulatory pathway for our device is an FDA 510(k) submission.</p>
<p>In the United States, an estimated 550,000 peripheral nerve repair surgeries are conducted annually. Approximately 185,000 limb amputations occur per year. The prevalence of symptomatic neuroma in lower extremity amputees is 15%. The device is intended for purchase and use explicitly by medical professionals. They will purchase directly from the manufacturer at a cost of < 20,000 USD per unit.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Neuroma formation occurs as a result of peripheral nerve injury followed by improper regeneration or repair. It is common at nerve ends or stumps, such as with amputation, where the regenerating nerve end lacks a distal target. The general etiology of nerve end neuroma is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Nerve injury (specifically to the perineurium, which allows for axonal escape), degenerating axons
<br>2. Axonal sprouts
<br>3. Unorganized bundles of axon
<br>4. Migration into fibrous tissue</p>
<p> Neuromas can cause debilitating pain and sensory loss. Aside from affecting quality of life, symptomatic neuroma can preclude the correct fitting and successful use of a prosthetic. Surgical management includes muscle or bone transposition—which removes the opportunity for sensory and motor recovery—and surgical excision. Excision alone does not mitigate the potential for neuroma recurrence; our design intends to address this problem while innovating on existing treatments.</p>

</table></center>
<p><b>Biocompatabilty:</b> Device needs to produce the appropriate host response for the given body contact and duration conditions: permanent contact: implant device (must pass ISO 10993-1 defined tests for cytotoxicity, irritation, and sensitization).</p>
<p><b>Cytotoxicity:</b> Device material(s) cannot cause significant cell damage or death as measured by a cytotoxicity assay (FDA requires implant devices to undergo cytotoxicity testing at 37℃ for 72 hours).</p>
<p><b>Different Sizes:</b> Device sizes of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm diameter to fit the range of nerve diameters for the wrist/dorsum base of the hand (cadaveric study findings on nerve diameter in the hand/wrist were used to determine the sizes needed).</p>
<p><b>Durability:</b> Degradation at predictable rate, support encapsulation of nerve stump for at least 40 weeks (40 weeks is an estimate; still looking for source).</p>
<p><b>Ease of Use in Clinic:</b> Storage life of at least 32 months. Does not require custom or specific surgical instruments for implantation (used shelf-life study of a bioprosthetic heart valve to estimate a reasonable storage life).</p>
<p><b>Low Cost:</b> Cost per unit less than 20,000 USD.</p>
<p><b>Reduce Symptomatic Neuroma:</b> Eliminate axonal outgrowth into muscle or fibrous tissue. Overall reduction in pain as measured by a visual analog scale.</p>
<p><b>Sterilization:</b> Device must meet the appropriate Sterility Assurance Level.</p>

    <p><b>Design overview:</b></p>
    <p>- Material is decellularized bovine pericardial tissue. The tissue is photo-oxidized to crosslink and stabilize the internal collagen structure, eliminate toxic by-products. The material is nonimmunogenic, biocompatible, and non-cytotoxic. It is strong, uniform, and easy to trim and shape. Similar to autologous tissue.
    <br>- Cap diameters of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm to fit the range of nerve diameters in the limbs.
    <br>- Flattened distal end for anchoring to soft tissue.
    <br>- Total length is 12 mm: 5 mm to fit over nerve, 4-5 mm of gap space (or “runway”), 2-3 mm end tab available for suture.
    <br>- Thickness is 0.5 &plusmn; 0.25 mm
    <br>- Cap luminal surface photochemically bonds to nerve epineurium. PTB uses light and a photosensitizing dye to crosslink the two collagenous surfaces.
    <br>- Ethylene oxide sterilization.</p>
    <p>Our final design is a biocompatible decellularized bovine pericardium cap with minimal permeability to insulate the nerve end from external neurotrophic factors and mechanical stimulation. The flexible cap shall fit over and photochemically bond to the nerve end for 360&#176; seal. Over time, the cap will vascularize and integrate with surrounding soft tissue.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, nerve guide conduit and cap surgeries use suture to fix the device to nerve. Suturing causes trauma to the nerve and may illicit tissue reactivity. Our final design specifies photochemical tissue bonding at the nerve–nerve cap contact surfaces. A photoactive dye, rose bengal, is applied to the tissue surfaces (epineurium and nerve cap luminal surface) followed by illumination of the surfaces with visible light. The dye absorbs strongly at the specified wavelength, and the energy of the absorbed photons drives photochemical reactions to form covalent bonds between protein molecules which bind the surfaces. This process occurs quickly with negligible temperature rise.</p>
<hr>
    <h2>Potential Market and Impact</h2>
    <p>The incidence of neuromas varies in literature. The majority of neuromas are asymptomatic and consequently, are undetected. A study of hand injuries found incidence at 1% after all nerve repair, and approximately 6 to 8% following digital amputation. It is suspected neuroma incidence is higher for hand, foot, lower and upper limb trauma where more nerves are affected. In fact, neuroma is the leading cause of pain in amputees. With 550,000 nerve repair surgeries and 185,000 limb amputations annually in the United States, it is fair to estimate the patient population is in the hundreds to low thousands.</p>
