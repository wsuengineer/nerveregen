        <h3>Neuroma</h3>
        <div class = "a">
            Neuromas are benign tumors of the nervous system and often arise post-trauma, including amputation and elective surgery. A neuroma develops as an injured nerve starts to regenerate in an uncontrolled way, resulting in a lump of entangled axon fibers and non-neural tissue growth. Neuroma is understood to result from misdirected Schwann cell processes causing pathophysiologic axonal outgrowth as the cells try to reinstate axonal continuity of the disrupted nerve end.
         <p>Neuroma formation occurs because of severe nerve injury (e.g., neurotmesis; axons, Schwann cells, and endoneurium are completely disrupted) followed by improper intrinsic nerve repair. It is especially common in amputees as no distal target exists for the regenerating axons. In some cases the neuroma causes pain and is referred to as symptomatic neuroma. Symptomatic neuroma may cause numerous effects such as making it difficult to mold a well-fitting prosthesis socket or preventing the successful use of a prosthetic, and brings about a clinical need to prevent painful neuroma formation.
         <p>Morphology of nerve at various stages of neuroma development:
         <br><br>1. Normal nerve
             <br>2. Degenerating axons
             <br>3. Axonal sprouts
             <br>4. Unorganized bundles of axons
             <br>5. Unorganized axon growth into muscle tissue 
             <br>6. Unorganized growth into fibrotic tissue (neuroma)

        <h3>Current Treatment</h3>
        <div class = "b">
             Diagnosis is mainly clinical, and treatment is most often surgical excision. Yet, surgical excision alone does not address the potential of neuroma to re-form.
          <p>In 2017, Axogen, Inc. received FDA approval for a porcine small intestine submucosa-based nerve cap to prevent/reduce neuroma. Following surgical resection of the current neuroma, the nerve stump is capped to isolate the regenerating cells from surrounding tissue.

          <p>A few areas for future research include material (i.e., address risk of xenograft rejection), intraluminal guidance structures to direct axonal outgrowth, and molecular therapy.
